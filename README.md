# DjangoKEP

For a basic understanding of everything covered in the KEP, you can refer the [Django Girls Tutorial.](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)

But the official [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) is the best place to dive deeper once you have got the basics right.
